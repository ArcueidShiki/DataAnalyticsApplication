If you don't have Live Server Extension on your vscode, install one.

You have to Open the htmls With Live Server. Otherwise, the browser will block javascript ajax request from origin "null" according to CORS policy.


```bash
# Or you could run with the following cmd under "frontend/" folder
python -m http.server 8889
```
